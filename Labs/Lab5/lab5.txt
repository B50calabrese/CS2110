Put your answers in this file and submit it under the T-Square assignment.


Problem 1
---------
A) The BILL 9000 computer has 16 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.

The addressability of this memory is...
	
	8-bits

The address space of this memory is...

	2^16 which is 65536

B) The NOOB 2110 computer has 7 address wires and has a 8 bit word size.
However memory addresses 0x00 - 0x1F are not able to be written to
or read from.

The addressability of this memory is...

	8-bits

The address space of this memory is...

	2^7 - 32 spaces or 96	

(Some things to think about)
- What is the addressability of your laptop computer?
- What is the address space of your laptop computer?


Problem 2
---------

What is the difference between combinational and sequential logic?

	Combinational is always the same output, like an XOR circuit, and sequential depends on the 
previous state of the circuit, like an R-S latch.


Complete the following table by marking an "x" where applicable.

|========================================|
| Component | Combinational | Sequential |
|========================================|
| ALU       |        X       |            |
| AND GATE  |	     X       |            |
| REGISTER  |               |     X       |
| MEMORY    |    	    |     X       |
| DECODER   |      X	    |            |
| RS LATCH  |      	    |	   X      |
=========================================|


Problem 3
---------
Make a 2-bit addressable memory that has a address space of 8. (i.e. there are 8 addresses each holding 2 bits)
You do not need to turn this circuit in, but it is highly recommend that you actually make it.


How many bits are there for the output of your memory?

	2 bits

How many bits are there for the address input of the memory?

	3 bits


Make sure to ask the TA's if you have any questions!
