1. DeMorgan's Law

Bill doesn't like us to teach new things in lab so don't tell him about this!
There is a property of boolean logic called DeMorgan's Law that states:

"The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations."

Or, simply put,

!(A && B) == (!A || !B)

For the first part of this assignment, you will be building a simple circuit to
demonstrate this principle.

In the template we have provided, fill in the missing logic gates and connect the
tunnels to the inputs. 

For the first gate, just use a simple OR gate.
For the second gate, use an AND gate, and invert the inputs and output.

You will notice the outputs for both gates are the same.

This is DeMorgan's law in action.


2. Transistors

Transistors are pretty cool. Lucky you gets to do a lab assignment on them!

Fill in the provided template circuits NAND and NOT with transistors to create 
the specified logic gates. 

There is only one stipulation, and that is you MUST follow this convention:

P-type transistors go on TOP of the diagram, connected to power
N-type transistors go on BOTTOM, connected to ground.

When you are finished with NAND and NOT, copy the transistors from each into the
AND circuit and combine them to make an AND gate.

If you have any questions, ask away!
